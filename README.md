Flow -> 
1. Terraform -> build vms
2. Ansible -> Configure the vms
    a. Task to install exporters on ec2 instance
3. CodePipeline -> For the ci/cd -> Triggered automatically when a change is pushed.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) -> Acts as an abstraction from the outside world
    1. Create a vpc. Example: vpc-flask-app
    2. Input a cidr range. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 -> This contains 65536 ip's 
Subnet -> These are subset's of vpc. Usually we create private and public subnets spread across two availability zones
    1. Create a public subnet. Example: public-subnet 
    2. Select the az
    3. Input the cidr range. Example: 192.168.0.1/24 -> This contains 255 ip's 
    4. Create a private subnet. Example: private-subnet
    5. select the az
    6. Input the cidr range. Example: 192.168.0.2/24
Internet Gateway -> provides access from the internet to the subnets(public subnet)
    1. Create a gateway, give it a name. Example gateway-flask-app
    2. Attach the Gateway to the vpc created earlier. Example: vpc-flask-app
Route Tables(Stateless) -> Used for routing traffic after it enters through the internet gateway -> All inbound and outbound traffic is allowed by default
    1. Create route tables. By default there will be a main route table when a vpc is created, that allows access within all the subnets of the vpc
    2. Create a public route table. Exmaple: flask-public-route
    3. Attach the vpc to this route table
    4. Creates rules for the route table ie. From(destination) and To(target)
    5. Since this is a public-route it should be from public-subnet to gateway-flask-app
    6. Associate the public subnets to this route table.
